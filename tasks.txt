Meeting 1: May 15, 2020

Taks:

	Final Objective: Obtain custom PCB to incorporate multiple cameras in PULP SoC	

	1. Study and understand the hardware (PULP SoC)
	2. Obtain the PCB files and understand them
	3. Figure out a way to interface multiple cameras on the SoC
	4. Make a list of software required for the task
	
Software Required:
	1. For PCB files: Altium
	2. Intel Quartus Prime (can work with lite)	

Hardware Requirement:
	1. For development purposes: GAPuino development board

Meeting 2: May 20, 2020

Tasks:
	1. Try to re-create PULP-SoC (with one camera) on Eagle CAD and estimate the time required for it
	2. Prepare a list of vendors supplying GAPuino in India
	3. Focus on low-level programing like interfacing camera with the PULP-SoC

Updated Tasks:
	1. Try GAP8 SDK instead of PULP-SDK
	2. Set-up and use GVSOC virtual platform


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Meeting 3: May 27, 2020

Tasks: 
	1. Simulating more complicated programs on GVSOC platform
	2. Try to read how to interface 2 cameras with the GAP SoC
	3. Login into Thanos (windows server) to use Altium
	4. Read on ETH Zurich's recent work

STEPS TO CONNECT TO THANOS

	1. SSH into helium
		ssh -X userid@ssh.esat.kuleuven.be

	2. SSH into servername
		ssh servername.esat.kuleuven.be

	3. Launch vncserver
		vncserver :3

	4. Close this connection
		exit
		exit

	5. Create a SSH Tunnel
		ssh -L 5903:servername.esat.kuleuven.be:5903 userid@ssh.esat.kuleuven.be

	// Note that we are using 5903 because we launched vncserver ':3'

	6. Open VNC Viewer
	
	7. Connect to the server
		using the ip: 127.0.0.1:3
