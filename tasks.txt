Meeting 1: May 15, 2020

Taks:

	Final Objective: Obtain custom PCB to incorporate multiple cameras in PULP SoC	

	1. Study and understand the hardware (PULP SoC)
	2. Obtain the PCB files and understand them
	3. Figure out a way to interface multiple cameras on the SoC
	4. Make a list of software required for the task
	
Software Required:
	1. For PCB files: Altium
	2. Intel Quartus Prime (can work with lite)	

Hardware Requirement:
	1. For development purposes: GAPuino development board

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting 2: May 20, 2020

Tasks:
	1. Try to re-create PULP-SoC (with one camera) on Eagle CAD and estimate the time required for it
	2. Prepare a list of vendors supplying GAPuino in India
	3. Focus on low-level programing like interfacing camera with the PULP-SoC

Updated Tasks:
	1. Try GAP8 SDK instead of PULP-SDK
	2. Set-up and use GVSOC virtual platform


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Meeting 3: May 27, 2020

Tasks: 
	1. Simulating more complicated programs on GVSOC platform
	2. Try to read how to interface 2 cameras with the GAP SoC
	3. Login into Thanos (windows server) to use Altium
	4. Read on ETH Zurich's recent work


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Meeting 4: June 3, 2020

Tasks:
	1. Study the internal architechture of GAP8
	2. Study different camera interfacing protocols
	3. Survey different camera modules supporting other protocols
	4. Try running examples codes and then build on that


To Discuss:

	1. GVSOC:
		1.1 Codes for HIMAX are now working: pmsis: lcd, stream
		1.2 Complicated applications such as pedestrian detection and edge detection are working
		1.3 Support for two other modules: GC0308, OV5640
			- couldn't get their code working, some problem in the libraries

	2. Camera Interfacing Protocols:
		2.1 CPI supports multi-camera interfacing but not simultaneous use
			- maybe we can trigger different camera modules in succession, if done fast enough should be useful
		2.2 CSI-2,3 is MIVI propritiery, supports multi-camera system for high-bandwidth, used in modern mobiles
		2.3 Camera modules are available supporting UART, (SPI+I2C) cameras, maybe can be used along with CPI
			- difficult to find QVGA ULP modules supporting these protocols

	3. GVSOC support for PULP
		- found support for it, works similar to the GAP GVSOC
		- Unable to compile using it, will try to re-install the PULP SDK

	
	4. GAPuino
		- I have mailed green-wave technologies


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Meeting 5: June 10, 2020


Tasks:
	1. Understand how CPI works in GAP and try simulating more than 1 cameras on GVSOC
	2. Try to make more advanced applications run
	

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting 6: JUne 17, 2020 

Tasks:
	1. Refine and test further the two camera interfacing code
	2. Try higher level applications such as Canny Edge Detection
	3. Develop low-level programs for SPI and GPIO (to interface with main MCU)
	4. Other sensors required within the drone? If yes, which interface and develop code
