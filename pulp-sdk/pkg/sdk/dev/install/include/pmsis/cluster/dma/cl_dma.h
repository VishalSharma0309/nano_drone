/**
 * @defgroup DMA DMA management
 *
 * The cluster has its own local memory for fast access from the cluster cores
 * while the other memories are relatively slow if accessed by the cluster.
 * To keep all the cores available for computation each cluster contains a DMA
 * unit whose role is to asynchronously transfer data between a remote memory
 * and the cluster memory.
 *
 * The following API can be used to control the DMA in various ways:
 *   - Simple completion. This is only usable by a cluster. A set of transfers
 *   can be queued together. An identifier is allocated for the first transfer
 *   and reused for the following transfers. This identifier can then be used to
 *   block the calling core until all transfers are completed.
 *   - Event-based completion. This can be used on either the fabric controller
 *   or a cluster to enqueue a transfer and get notified on completion via an
 *   event on the fabric controller.
